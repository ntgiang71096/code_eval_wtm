It is not recommendable to use this function without any additional unit testing or test case coverage as the encoded and/or decode strings can only exhibit uniform effects when encoded and/or decode with different inputs.

It can also be easily adaptated to take any type of list as the input and output a list containing the derivatives of a different polynomial type.

{"task_id": "HumanEval/90", "completion": "We're using a sorted list as the priority queue, so we don't have to do anything extra for our implementation of next_smallest(). The function will return the 2nd item in a sorted list assuming it is not an already-empty list. It's a little tricky because there may be multiple 2nd item in a sorted list. We can check the length of the priority queue and use popitem(False / None / -1) for 2nd item or popitem(False / None / 0) for 1'st, so we don't have to take any action to take the 2nd item or return 1'st when length is zero. It's a little bit tricky because the priority queue is sorted, so we don't have to use pop() or popitem(), which may remove any other elements. We can solve that issue using the popitem(False / None / -1) method. It's a little bit like the tricky part from last time, but instead of popping the 2nd item from a list or priority queue, it's using the popitem(False / None / -1) method, which remove and returns the 2nd item from a list. So when length of priority queue is zero we will always return the 2nd item from a sorted list. We can easily solve that issue using the popitem(False / None / -1) method. We can return the 2nd item from a sorted list assuming it is not an already-empty list. Check the length of the priority queue using the len(lst), return the 2nd item from a sorted list assuming it is not an already-empty list using the popitem(False / None / -1) method and remove that two items using the popitem(False / None / -1) method.

It starts with 14, which evenly divide 12 \nand15 and it's divisibility test passes. So 14 will be the return value.\n\nIf there's no return value, it will return -1. To check this, it will \nfirst need a divisibility test for 13, which evenly divide 12 \nand15 and it's divisibility test will not pass because 13 is \nodd :). So -1 will be the return value.\n\ndef choose_num( x  :  int ,  \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n"}

In order to create a valid file's name we need three conditions: 1) there can \nbe no more that 4 digits from 0-9, 2;) the name must contain only one '.' and 3) the \nsubstring after the dot should match any of the 3 valid file-endings: \".txt\",\n\"\"txt\"\" etc.\n\nWe need a way of identifiang the substring between two characters and to do so we use \nthe index() and index() +3 methods, which can return the substring from start to index \n+ 3 in case they are found, or return -1 in case they are not found. In this case \nthe index() +3 will return 3 since '.' will be the substring after the dot.\n\nHeres a complete code for a valid file's name check\n\ndef isFileValid(filename, valid_endings):\n    if len(filename[0 : len(filename)].replace('.', '')) >=  3:  \n        return False\n    if not filename.startswith ('.'):  \n        return False\n    if not '.'  + str.lower(filename[-1]) == str.lower(filename[-1]): \n        return False\n    if str.lower(filename[-1]) not in  valid_endings:  \n        return False\n    \n    dot_index  =  index  + 3\n\n    if -1 ==   ( dot_index  =  index  + 3): \n        return False\n    \n    if str.lower(filename[0 :  index  + 3)) \n     !=   (str  + str.lower(filename[-1]))[ :  index  + 3]:\n        return False\n    \n    \n    #if everything is good  \n    #return True\n\ndef isFileValid(filename, valid_endings):\n    if len(filename[0 : len(filename)].replace('.', '')) >=  3:  \n        return False\n    if not filename.startswith ('.'):  \n        return False\n    if not '.'  + str.lower(filename[-1]) == str"}
